DAX queries for detailed analysis:

AgeGroup:
AgeGroup = SWITCH(TRUE(), 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30", 
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+", "unknown" )

IncomeGroup:
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(TRUE(),
 'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
 'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] < 70000, "Med",
 'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
 "unknown"
)

Revenue Calculation:
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]
Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]), FILTER(ALL('public cc_detail'), 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])))
Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]), FILTER(ALL('public cc_detail'), 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1))

ðŸ“ˆ Insights and Recommendations:
Based on the data analysis, I have identified several key insights and recommendations to improve credit card operations:
Focus on marketing Blue & Silver credit cards as they contribute significantly to transactions.
Enhance customer engagement strategies in TX, NY, and CA to capitalize on their high contribution rates.
Develop targeted financial products and services for male customers, who contribute more to revenue.
